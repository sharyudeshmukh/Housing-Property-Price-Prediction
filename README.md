# Housing-Property-Price-Prediction

Understanding the customer needs and predicting the customerâ€™s purchase intents is the core
for success for any business. From this dataset we are trying to accurately predict the final
price of each property in the city of Ames Iowa, based on a number of predictor variables
that we have been given. The goal of the problem is to utilize machine learning tools to make
the best possible prediction of house prices. This is an interesting problem because most
people will eventually buy/sell a home. This problem allows us, as data scientists, to learn
more about the housing market and helps with making more informed decisions.
